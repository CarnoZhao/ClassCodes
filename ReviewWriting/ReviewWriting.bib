Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an indispensable tool to dissect the cellular heterogeneity and decompose tissues into cell types and/or cell states, which offers enormous potential for de novo discovery. Single-cell transcriptomic atlases provide unprecedented resolution to reveal complex cellular events and deepen our understanding of biological systems. In this review, we summarize and compare single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, that were developed since 2009, to facilitate a well-informed choice of method. The applications of these methods in different biological contexts are also discussed. We anticipate an everincreasing role of single-cell RNA sequencing in biology with further improvement in providing spatial information and coupling to other cellular modalities. In the future, such biological ﬁndings will greatly beneﬁt medical research.},

Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) are among the best-characterized neuronal types: different PN classes target dendrites to distinct olfactory glomeruli, while PNs of the same class exhibit indistinguishable anatomical and physiological properties. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of most PN classes and unequivocally mapped transcriptomes to speciﬁc olfactory function for six classes. Transcriptomes of closely related PN classes exhibit the largest differences during circuit assembly but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed genes between classes and are highly informative in encoding cell identity, enabling us to identify a new lineage-speciﬁc transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting. These ﬁndings establish that neuronal transcriptomic identity corresponds with anatomical and physiological identity deﬁned by connectivity and function.},

The mammalian brain has an extraordinarily large number of cells. Although there are quite a few different cell types, many cells in any one category tend to look alike. Zeisel et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of mouse brain cells to reveal more than meets the eye. Interneurons of similar type were found in dissimilar regions of the brain. Oligodendrocytes that seemed to be all of one class were differentiated by their molecular signatures into a half-dozen classes. Microglia associated with blood vessels were distinguished from look-alike perivascular macrophages. Thus, the complex microanatomy of the brain can be revealed by the RNAs expressed in its cells.
Science, this issue p. 1138
The mammalian cerebral cortex supports cognitive functions such as sensorimotor integration, memory, and social behaviors. Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.
A close look at the genes expressed by cells in the brain reveals hidden and coordinated cellular complexity.

The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system, and its proper development is vital for maintaining human life. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the gene expression landscapes of ∼4,000 cardiac cells from human embryos and identified four major types of cells: cardiomyocytes (CMs), cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), and valvar interstitial cells (VICs). Atrial and ventricular CMs acquired distinct features early in heart development. Furthermore, both CMs and fibroblasts show stepwise changes in gene expression. As development proceeds, VICs may be involved in the remodeling phase, and ECs display location-specific characteristics. Finally, we compared gene expression profiles between humans and mice and identified a series of unique features of human heart development.

Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.

The liver is a central regulator of metabolism, and liver failure thus constitutes a major health burden. Understanding how this complex organ develops during embryogenesis will yield insights into how liver regeneration can be promoted and how functional liver replacement tissue can be engineered. Recent studies of animal models have identified key signaling pathways and complex tissue interactions that progressively generate liver progenitor cells, differentiated lineages and functional tissues. In addition, progress in understanding how these cells interact, and how transcriptional and signaling programs precisely coordinate liver development, has begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this complexity. Here, we review the lineage relationships, signaling pathways and transcriptional programs that orchestrate hepatogenesis.},

Generating a precise cellular and molecular cartography of the human embryo is essential to our understanding of the mechanisms of organogenesis in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we have combined whole-mount immunostaining, 3DISCO clearing, and light-sheet imaging to start building a 3D cellular map of the human development during the first trimester of gestation. We provide high-resolution 3D images of the developing peripheral nervous, muscular, vascular, cardiopulmonary, and urogenital systems. We found that the adult-like pattern of skin innervation is established before the end of the first trimester, showing important intra- and inter-individual variations in nerve branches. We also present evidence for a differential vascularization of the male and female genital tracts concomitant with sex determination. This work paves the way for a cellular and molecular reference atlas of human cells, which will be of paramount importance to understanding human development in health and disease.

BackgroundBecause of their differentiation potential, pluripotent stem cells can generate virtually any cell type and, as such, can be used to model development and disease and even hold the promise of providing cell-replacement therapies. Recently, structures resembling whole organs, termed organoids, have been generated from stem cells through the development of three-dimensional culture systems.Organoids are derived from pluripotent stem cells or isolated organ progenitors that differentiate to form an organlike tissue exhibiting multiple cell types that self-organize to form a structure not unlike the organ in vivo. This technology builds upon a foundation of stem cell technologies, as well as classical developmental biology and cell-mixing experiments. These studies illustrated two key events in structural organization during organogenesis: cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment. Both of these processes are recapitulated in organoids, which self-assemble to form the cellular organization of the organ itself.
{\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/345/6194/1247125/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{\textgreater}Organoid generation and therapeutic potential. Organoids can be derived for a number of organs from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Like organogenesis in vivo, organoids self-organize through both cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment of precursor cells. Organoids can be used to model disease by introducing disease mutations or using patient-derived PSCs. Future applications could include drug testing and even tissue replacement therapy.
AdvancesOrganoids have been generated for a number of organs from both mouse and human stem cells. To date, human pluripotent stem cells have been coaxed to generate intestinal, kidney, brain, and retinal organoids, as well as liver organoid-like tissues called liver buds. Derivation methods are specific to each of these systems, with a focus on recapitulation of endogenous developmental processes. Specifically, the methods so far developed use growth factors or nutrient combinations to drive the acquisition of organ precursor tissue identity. Then, a permissive three-dimensional culture environment is applied, often involving the use of extracellular matrix gels such as Matrigel. This allows the tissue to self-organize through cell sorting out and stem cell lineage commitment in a spatially defined manner to recapitulate organization of different organ cell types.These complex structures provide a unique opportunity to model human organ development in a system remarkably similar to development in vivo. Although the full extent of similarity in many cases still remains to be determined, organoids are already being applied to human-specific biological questions. Indeed, brain and retinal organoids have both been shown to exhibit properties that recapitulate human organ development and that cannot be observed in animal models. Naturally, limitations exist, such as the lack of blood supply, but future endeavors will advance the technology and, it is hoped, fully overcome these technical hurdles.
OutlookThe therapeutic promise of organoids is perhaps the area with greatest potential. These unique tissues have the potential to model developmental disease, degenerative conditions, and cancer. Genetic disorders can be modeled by making use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells or by introducing disease mutations. Indeed, this type of approach has already been taken to generate organoids from patient stem cells for intestine, kidney, and brain.Furthermore, organoids that model disease can be used as an alternative system for drug testing that may not only better recapitulate effects in human patients but could also cut down on animal studies. Liver organoids, in particular, represent a system with high expectations, particularly for drug testing, because of the unique metabolic profile of the human liver. Finally, tissues derived in vitro could be generated from patient cells to provide alternative organ replacement strategies. Unlike current organ transplant treatments, such autologous tissues would not suffer from issues of immunocompetency and rejection.
The making of bodies part by part
Mention of organoids—organlike structure growing in a Petri dish—might conjure up images of science fiction. However, the generation of organoids is very real, as is the increased understanding of organ form and function that comes from studying them. Lancaster and Knoblich review organoids as structures that include more than one cell type of an organ that exhibit structural and functional features of the natural counterpart. Knowledge of normal organ developmental pathways guides the formation of these structures. Organoids show great promise for modeling human development and disease and for biomedical research and regenerative medicine.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1247125
Classical experiments performed half a century ago demonstrated the immense self-organizing capacity of vertebrate cells. Even after complete dissociation, cells can reaggregate and reconstruct the original architecture of an organ. More recently, this outstanding feature was used to rebuild organ parts or even complete organs from tissue or embryonic stem cells. Such stem cell–derived three-dimensional cultures are called organoids. Because organoids can be grown from human stem cells and from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, they have the potential to model human development and disease. Furthermore, they have potential for drug testing and even future organ replacement strategies. Here, we summarize this rapidly evolving field and outline the potential of organoid technology for future biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The mammalian prefrontal cortex comprises a set of highly specialized brain areas containing billions of cells and serves as the centre of the highest-order cognitive functions, such as memory, cognitive ability, decision-making and social behaviour1,2. Although neural circuits are formed in the late stages of human embryonic development and even after birth, diverse classes of functional cells are generated and migrate to the appropriate locations earlier in development. Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex contributes to cognitive deficits and the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders; there is therefore a need for detailed knowledge of the development of the prefrontal cortex. However, it is still difficult to identify cell types in the developing human prefrontal cortex and to distinguish their developmental features. Here we analyse more than 2,300 single cells in the developing human prefrontal cortex from gestational weeks 8 to 26 using RNA sequencing. We identify 35 subtypes of cells in six main classes and trace the developmental trajectories of these cells. Detailed analysis of neural progenitor cells highlights new marker genes and unique developmental features of intermediate progenitor cells. We also map the timeline of neurogenesis of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex and detect the presence of interneuron progenitors in early developing prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we reveal the intrinsic development-dependent signals that regulate neuron generation and circuit formation using single-cell transcriptomic data analysis. Our screening and characterization approach provides a blueprint for understanding the development of the human prefrontal cortex in the early and mid-gestational stages in order to systematically dissect the cellular basis and molecular regulation of prefrontal cortex function in humans.},

We investigated the impact of transcriptional complexity on current models of key signaling pathways controlling ESC pluripotency and differentiation, highlighting how SQRL can be used to characterize transcriptome content and dynamics in a quantitative and reproducible manner, and suggesting that our understanding of transcriptional complexity is far from complete.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions. However, systematic comparisons of the performance of diverse scRNA-seq protocols are lacking. We generated data from 583 mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate six prominent scRNA-seq methods: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq, and Smart-seq2. While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.},

Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state by transfer of nuclear contents into oocytes or by fusion with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes. Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development. These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from fibroblast cultures by the addition of only a few defined factors.},

Following on these findings, we use PCR products from different cell types to identify novel pancreatic genes, some of which mark subtypes of developing pancreatic cells.

First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

Thymus development is critical to the adaptive immune system, yet a comprehensive transcriptional framework capturing thymus organogenesis at single-cell resolution is still needed. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to capture 8 days of thymus development, perturbations of T cell receptor rearrangement, and in vitro organ cultures, producing profiles of 24,279 cells. We resolved transcriptional heterogeneity of developing lymphocytes, and genetic perturbation confirmed T cell identity of conventional and non-conventional lymphocytes. We characterized maturation dynamics of thymic epithelial cells in vivo, classified cell maturation state in a thymic organ culture, and revealed the intrinsic capacity of thymic epithelium to preserve transcriptional regularity despite exposure to exogenous retinoic acid. Finally, by integrating the cell atlas with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and autoimmune-disease-related genes, we implicated embryonic thymus-resident cells as possible participants in autoimmune disease etiologies.

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of the developing pancreatic epithelium and low abundance of endocrine progenitors limit the information derived from traditional expression studies. To identify genes that characterize early developmental tissues composed of multiple progenitor lineages, we applied single-cell RNA-Seq to embryonic day (e) 13.5 mouse pancreata and performed integrative analysis with single cell data from mature pancreas. We identified subpopulations expressing macrophage or endothelial markers and new pancreatic progenitor markers. We also identified potential alpha-cell precursors expressing glucagon (Gcg) among the e13.5 pancreatic cells. Despite their high Gcg expression levels, these cells shared greater transcriptomic similarity with other e13.5 cells than with adult alpha-cells, indicating their immaturity. Comparative analysis identified the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, Slc38a5, as a characteristic gene expressed in alpha-cellprecursors but not mature cells. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed SLC38A5 expression in pancreatic progenitors, including in a subset of NEUROG3+ endocrine progenitors and MAFB+ cells and in all GCG+ cells. Expression declined in alpha-cells during late gestation and was absent in the adult islet. Our results suggest SLC38A5 as an early marker of alpha-cell lineage commitment.},

As a result of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) individual cells delaminate from this primitive epicardial epithelium and migrate into the subepicardial space (Pérez-Pomares et al., Dev Dyn 1997; 210:96–105; Histochem J 1998a;30:627–634). Several studies have demonstrated that these epicardially derived cells (EPDCs) subsequently invade myocardial and valvuloseptal tissues (Mikawa and Fischman, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1992;89:9504–9508; Mikawa and Gourdie, Dev Biol 1996;174:221–232; Dettman et al., Dev Biol 1998;193:169–181; Gittenberger de Groot et al., Circ Res 1998;82:1043–1052; Manner, Anat Rec 1999;255:212–226; Pérez-Pomares et al., Dev.

A subset of EPDCs continue to differentiate in a variety of different cell types (including coronary endothelium, coronary smooth muscle cells (CoSMCs), interstitial fibroblasts, and atrioventricular cushion mesenchymal cells), whereas other EPDCs remain in a more or less undifferentiated state. Based on its specific characteristics, we consider the EPDC as the ultimate ‘cardiac stem cell’. In this review we briefly summarize what is known about events that relate to EPDC development and differentiation while at the same time identifying some of the directions where EPDC-related research might lead us in the near future.

Cardiac fibroblasts have important functions during development, homeostasis, and disease. However, since fibroblasts are a very heterogeneous cell population no truly specific markers exist. Therefore, studying them in detail is difficult. Nevertheless, several lineage tracing models have been widely used. In this review, we describe the developmental origins of cardiac fibroblasts, comment on fibroblast markers and related lineage tracing approaches, and discuss the cardiac cell composition, which has recently been revised, especially in terms of non-myocyte cells.},

Here we show that changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix during this week can affect cardiomyocyte growth and differentiation in mice. We identify agrin, a component of neonatal extracellular matrix, as required for the full regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse hearts. In vitro, recombinant agrin promotes the division of cardiomyocytes that are derived from mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cells through a mechanism that involves the disassembly of the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex, and Yap- and ERK-mediated signalling. In vivo, a single administration of agrin promotes cardiac regeneration in adult mice after myocardial infarction, although the degree of cardiomyocyte proliferation observed in this model suggests that there are additional therapeutic mechanisms. Together, our results uncover a new inducer of mammalian heart regeneration and highlight fundamental roles of the extracellular matrix in cardiac repair.},

Likewise, information processing capacity is generally higher in primates due to short interneuronal distance and high axonal conduction velocity. Across primate taxa, differences in intelligence correlate best with differences in number of cortical neurons and synapses plus information processing speed. The human brain stands out by having a large cortical volume with relatively high NPD, high conduction velocity, and high cortical parcellation.

Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen.

Here we show that the expression patterns of several key transcription factors in the developing primate telencephalon are very similar to those in rodents, delineating the three main subcortical progenitor domains (the medial, lateral and caudal ganglionic eminences) and the interneurons tangentially migrating from them. On the basis of the continuity of Sox6, COUP-TFII and Sp8 transcription factor expression and evidence from cell migration and cell fate analyses, we propose that the majority of primate neocortical GABAergic interneurons originate from ganglionic eminences of the ventral telencephalon.

	abstract = {In neuronal precursor cells, the magnitude and longevity of mitogen-activated protein ( MAP) kinase cascade activation contribute to the nature of the cellular response, differentiation, or proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which neurotrophins promote prolonged MAP kinase signaling are not well understood. Here we defined the Rin GTPase as a novel component of the regulatory machinery contributing to the selective integration of MAP kinase signaling and neuronal development. Rin is expressed exclusively in neurons and is activated by neurotrophin signaling, and loss-of-function analysis demonstrates that Rin makes an essential contribution to nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation. Most surprisingly, although Rin was unable to stimulate MAP kinase activity in NIH 3T3 cells, it potently activated isoform-specific p38 alpha MAP kinase signaling and weakly stimulated ERK signaling in pheochromocytoma (PC6) cells. This cell-type specificity is explained in part by the finding that Rin binds and stimulates b-Raf but does not activate c-Raf. Accordingly, selective down-regulation of Rin in PC6 cells suppressed neurotrophin-elicited activation of b-Raf and p38, without obvious effects on NGF-induced ERK activation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neurite outgrowth was inhibited by Rin knockdown. Together, these observations establish Rin as a neuronal specific regulator of neurotrophin signaling, required to couple NGF stimulation to sustain activation of p38 MAP kinase and b-Raf signaling cascades required for neuronal development.},

In the adult, the DE provides a protective barrier against the environment and assumes many essential functions including digestion, nutrient absorption, and glucose homeostasis. Since general endoderm formation and patterning have been reviewed recently in a comprehensive manner [1], we will only provide a brief summary of how extracellular signals and downstream transcription factors control endoderm patterning. We will then focus on emerging work addressing the chromatin remodeling events occurring during endoderm organ specification and discuss how these molecular tools can be used to engineer endodermal organs in vitro.},

In humans, however, identifying bacteria that preferentially affect disease susceptibility and severity remains a major challenge. Here, we used flow-cytometry-based bacterial cell sorting and 16S sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) and show that high IgA coating uniquely identifies colitogenic intestinal bacteria in a mouse model of microbiota-driven colitis. We then used IgA-SEQ and extensive anaerobic culturing of fecal bacteria from IBD patients to create personalized disease-associated gut microbiota culture collections with predefined levels of IgA coating. Using these collections, we found that intestinal bacteria selected on the basis of high coating with IgA conferred dramatic susceptibility to colitis in germfree mice. Thus, our studies suggest that IgA coating identifies inflammatory commensals that preferentially drive intestinal disease. Targeted elimination of such bacteria may reduce, reverse, or even prevent disease development.},

We report that Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is expressed by mature colonocytes and regulates their differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling restricts the expression of Wnt targets to the base of the colonic crypt in vivo, and transfection of Ihh into colon cancer cells leads to a downregulation of both components of the nuclear TCF4-beta-catenin complex and abrogates endogenous Wnt signaling in vitro. In turn, expression of Ihh is downregulated in polyps of individuals with FAP and expression of doxycycline-inducible dominant negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) restores Ihh expression in APC mutant DLD-1 colon cancer cells.

	abstract = {Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids1, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances2. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells3. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.},

	abstract = {In multicellular organisms, biological function emerges when heterogeneous cell types form complex organs. Nevertheless, dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.
Introducing MARS-Seq
Immune cells are typically differentiated by surface markers; however, this designation is somewhat crude and does not allow for fine distinctions that might be characterized by their RNA transcripts. Jaitin et al. (p. 776) used massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-Seq) analysis to explore cellular heterogeneity within the immune system by assembling an automated experimental platform that enables RNA profiling of cells sorted from tissues using flow cytometry. More than 1000 cells could be sequenced, and unsupervised clustering analysis of the RNA profiles revealed distinct cellular groupings that corresponded to B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This approach provides the ability to perform a bottom-up characterization of in vivo cell-type landscapes independent of cell markers or prior knowledge.
Sequencing of RNA from thousands of individual immune cells allows unbiased identification of cellular subtypes.

Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect disease-associated differential expression.

To understand organ function, it is important to have an inventory of its cell types and of their corresponding marker genes. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence, transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity.

	abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers1,2,3 and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

Here, we demonstrate that rare, low-frequency and common alleles at one gene locus, phospholipase B1 (PLB1), might contribute to risk of RA in a 4-generation consanguineous pedigree (Middle Eastern ancestry) and also in unrelated individuals from the general population (European ancestry). Through identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a non-synonymous c.2263G{\textgreater}C (p.G755R) mutation at the PLB1 gene on 2q23, which significantly co-segregated with RA in family members with a dominant mode of inheritance (P = 0.009). We further evaluated PLB1 variants and risk of RA using a GWAS meta-analysis of 8,875 RA cases and 29,367 controls of European ancestry. We identified significant contributions of two independent non-coding variants near PLB1 with risk of RA (rs116018341 [MAF = 0.042] and rs116541814 [MAF = 0.021], combined P = 3.2×10−6). Finally, we performed deep exon sequencing of PLB1 in 1,088 RA cases and 1,088 controls (European ancestry), and identified suggestive dispersion of rare protein-coding variant frequencies between cases and controls (P = 0.049 for C-alpha test and P = 0.055 for SKAT). Together, these data suggest that PLB1 is a candidate risk gene for RA. Future studies to characterize the full spectrum of genetic risk in the PLB1 genetic locus are warranted.},

How this process is regulated in single mTECs and is coordinated at the population level, such that the varied single-cell patterns add up to faithfully represent TRAs, is poorly understood. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing and obtained evidence of numerous recurring TRA–co-expression patterns, each present in only a subset of mTECs. Co-expressed genes clustered in the genome and showed enhanced chromatin accessibility. Our findings characterize TRA expression in mTECs as a coordinated process that might involve local remodeling of chromatin and thus ensures a comprehensive representation of the immunological self.},

Acute thymic atrophy is a complication of many infections, environmental stressors, clinical preparative regimens, and cancer treatments used today. This undesirable sequela can decrease host ability to reconstitute the peripheral T cell repertoire and respond to new antigens. Currently, there are no treatments available to protect against acute thymic atrophy or accelerate recovery, thus leaving the immune system compromised during acute stress events. Several useful murine models are available for mechanistic studies of acute thymic atrophy, including a sepsis model of endotoxin-induced thymic involution. We have identified the IL-6 cytokine gene family members (i.e., leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, and oncostatin M) as thymosuppressive agents by the observation that they can acutely involute the thymus when injected into a young, healthy mouse. We have gone on to explore the role of thymosuppressive cytokines and specifically defined a corticosteroid-dependent mechanism of action for the leukemia inhibitory factor in acute thymic atrophy. We also have identified leptin as a novel, thymostimulatory agent that can protect against endotoxin-induced acute thymic atrophy. This review will highlight mechanisms of stress-induced thymic involution and focus on thymosuppressive agents involved in atrophy induction and thymostimulatory agents that may be exploited for therapeutic use.},

Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell’s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington’s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The cells clustered into populations of α-cells (5\%), β-cells (92\%), δ-cells (1\%), and pancreatic polypeptide cells (2\%). We identified cell-type–specific transcription factors and pathways primarily involved in nutrient sensing and oxidation and cell signaling. Unexpectedly, 281 cells had to be removed from the analysis due to low viability, low sequencing quality, or contamination resulting in the detection of more than one islet hormone. Collectively, we provide a resource for identification of high-quality gene expression datasets to help expand insights into genes and pathways characterizing islet cell types. We reveal limitations in the C1 Fluidigm cell capture process resulting in contaminated cells with altered gene expression patterns.

The beta-cell response consisted of an initial peak of 20- to 25-fold above basal and a less marked secondary phase. However, BCH produced only a delayed response, while leucine was totally ineffective when islets were pretreated with 25 mmol/l glucose plus Q2. With Q2, 10 mmol/l BCH or leucine caused a nearly threefold increase, a twofold increase, or had no effect on cytosolic Ca2+ levels in islets pretreated for 40 min with 0, 5, or 15 mmol/l glucose, respectively. Thus, pretreatment of islets with high glucose inhibited BCH- and leucine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ changes and insulin release. Glucose decreased glutamine oxidation in cultured rat islets when BCH was present at 10 mmol/l, but not in its absence, with a lowest effective level of approximately 0.1 mmol/l, a maximum of 18-30 mmol/l, and an inhibitory concentration, 50\%, of approximately 3 mmol/l. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that glucose inhibits glutaminolysis in pancreatic beta-cells in a concentration-dependent manner and hence blocks leucine-stimulated insulin secretion. We postulate that in the basal interprandial state, glutaminolysis of beta-cells is partly turned on because glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is activated by a decreased P-potential due to partial fuel depletion and sensitization to endogenous activators such as leucine. Additionally, it may contribute significantly to basal insulin release, which is known to be responsible for about half of the insulin released daily. The data explain "leucine-hypersensitivity" of beta-cells during hypoglycemia and contribute to the elucidation of the GDH-linked syndrome of hyperinsulinism associated with elevated serum ammonia levels. Thus, understanding the precise regulation and role of beta-cell glutaminolysis is probably central to our concept of normal blood glucose control.},

Extensive research on pancreas development over the last few years, largely driven by a translational potential for pancreatic diseases (diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and so on), is markedly advancing our knowledge of these processes. It is a tenable goal that we will one day have a clear, complete picture of the transcriptional and signaling codes that control the entire organogenetic process, allowing us to apply this knowledge in a therapeutic context, by generating replacement cells in vitro, or perhaps one day to the whole organ in vivo. This review summarizes findings in the past 5 years that we feel are amongst the most significant in contributing to the deeper understanding of pancreas development. Rather than try to cover all aspects comprehensively, we have chosen to highlight interesting new concepts, and to discuss provocatively some of the more controversial findings or proposals. At the end of the review, we include a perspective section on how the whole pancreas differentiation process might be able to be unwound in a regulated fashion, or redirected, and suggest linkages to the possible reprogramming of other pancreatic cell-types in vivo, and to the optimization of the forward-directed-differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), or induced pluripotential cells (iPSC), towards mature ?-cells.

	abstract = {Hepatoblasts are common progenitors for hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, although their nature remains largely unknown. In order to isolate and to characterize hepatoblasts, we searched for cell surface antigens expressed in mouse fetal hepatic cells by the signal sequence trap method and found that Dlk, also known as Pref-1, was strongly expressed in fetal liver. Immunohistochemical as well as northern analysis indicated that Dlk was highly expressed in the E10.5 liver bud. The strong expression continued until the E16.5 stage and was significantly downregulated thereafter. Using a monoclonal antibody against Dlk, we isolated Dlk+ cells either by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter or by an automatic magnetic cell sorter. Dlk+ cells isolated from fetal livers expressed albumin and formed colonies when cultured at low density with HGF and EGF for 5 days. Over 60\% of colonies derived from E14.5 Dlk+ cells contained both albumin+ and cytokeratin 19+ cells, indicating that a majority of colony-forming Dlk+ cells are able to differentiate into both hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell lineages. In addition, numerous microvilli were observed by electronmicroscopic analysis in most of those cultured cells, also indicating differentiation of Dlk+ cells under this condition. Furthermore, 7\% of the colony-forming Dlk+ cells were not only bipotential but also highly proliferative, forming a large colony containing more than 100 cells during 5 days of culture. By transplantation of Dlk+ cells into the spleen, donor-derived hepatocytes were found in the recipient liver, indicating that Dlk+ cells differentiated into hepatocytes in vivo. These results indicate that Dlk+ cells are hepatoblasts and that Dlk is a useful marker to enrich highly proliferative hepatoblasts from fetal liver.},

Our group and others have shown that a prospectively defined population in mid-gestational fetal liver contains hepatic stem/progenitor cells. However, the phenotypes of such cells are incompletely elucidated. We analyzed the profile of cell-surface molecules on primary hepatic stem/progenitor cells.
METHODS: Expression of cell surface molecules on primary hepatic stem/progenitor cells in mouse mid-gestational fetal liver was analyzed using flow cytometric multicolor analyses and colony-formation assays. The potential of the cells for liver repopulation was examined by transplantation assay.
RESULTS: We found that CD13 (aminopeptidase N) was detected on the cells of the previously reported (Dlk/Pref-1(+)) hepatic stem/progenitor fraction. Colony-formation assays revealed that the CD13(+) fraction, compared with the Dlk(+) fraction, of non-hematopoietic cells in fetal liver was enriched in hepatic stem/progenitor cells. Transplantation assay showed the former fraction exhibited repopulating potential in regenerating liver. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis for over 90 antigens demonstrated enrichment of hepatic stem/progenitor cells using several positive selection markers, including (hitherto unknown) CD13, CD73, CD106, and CD133.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that CD13 is a positive selection marker for hepatic stem/progenitor cells in mid-gestational fetal liver.},

Notch signaling is required for normal duct formation, but its mode of action has been unclear. Here, we show in mice that bile ducts arise through a novel mechanism of tubulogenesis involving sequential radial differentiation. Notch signaling is activated in a subset of liver progenitor cells fated to become ductal cells, and pathway activation is necessary for biliary fate. Notch signals are also required for bile duct morphogenesis, and activation of Notch signaling in the hepatic lobule promotes ectopic biliary differentiation and tubule formation in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, activation of Notch signaling in postnatal hepatocytes causes them to adopt a biliary fate through a process of reprogramming that recapitulates normal bile duct development. These results reconcile previous conflicting reports about the role of Notch during liver development and suggest that Notch acts by coordinating biliary differentiation and morphogenesis.},

Hepatic oval cells are considered to be facultative hepatic stem cells (HSCs) that differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in severely injured liver. Hepatic oval cells have also been implicated in tumorigenesis. However, their nature and origin remain elusive. To isolate and characterize mouse oval cells, we searched for cell surface molecules expressed on oval cells and analyzed their nature at the single-cell level by flow cytometric analysis and in the in vitro colony formation assay. We demonstrate that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is expressed in both mouse normal cholangiocytes and oval cells, whereas its related protein, TROP2, is expressed exclusively in oval cells, establishing TROP2 as a novel marker to distinguish oval cells from normal cholangiocytes. EpCAM+ cells isolated from injured liver proliferate to form colonies in vitro, and the clonally expanded cells differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, suggesting that the oval cell fraction contains potential HSCs. Interestingly, such cells with HSC characteristics exist among EpCAM+ cells of normal liver. Intriguingly, comparison of the colony formation of EpCAM+ cells in normal and injured liver reveals little difference in the number of potential HSCs, strongly suggesting that most proliferating mouse oval cells represent transit-amplifying cells rather than HSCs.},

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473},
	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. This may present serious issues in subsequent analyses. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees. Based on our results, we conclude that the Leiden algorithm is preferable to the Louvain algorithm.},

This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links.
