## Problem 1 (4 points)

In lab this week you used the `simulated_trees.csv` dataset to specify a linear regression model with tree age (years) as the outcome variable and tree height (centimeters) as the predictor variable. Using the same dataset, do the following:

- create a centered tree height variable

- plot tree age (y-axis) vs. the centered tree height variable (x-axis)

- fit a linear regression model for tree age using centered tree height as the predictor variable

Assume a prior of `dnorm(0, 50)` for both the intercept and slope parameters and a prior of `dcauchy(0, 5)` for the standard deviation parameter. Also note, you'll need to use start values as follows to ensure a good model fit: intercept parameter = 50, slope parameter = 0, standard deviation parameter = 50. 

Summarize your fit model parameters using 99% PIs. How do the parameter posteriors in this model compare to the linear regression you fit during lab? How do you interpret the intercept parameter in this model?

```{r, out.width = "25em", fig.align = "center"}
d = read.csv('simulated_trees.csv')
centered.height = d$height - mean(d$height)
centered.d = data.frame(centered.height, d$age)
colnames(centered.d) = c('centered.height', 'age')
ggplot(centered.d, aes(x = centered.height, y = d$age)) + 
	geom_point() + 
	xlab('Centered Height') + 
	ylab('Age') + 
	ggtitle('Age ~ Centered Height')
model = map(
	alist(
		age ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), 
		mu <- a + b * centered.height,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 50),
		b ~ dnorm(0, 50),
		sigma ~ dcauchy(0, 5)),
	start = list(a = 50, b = 0, sigma = 50),
	data = centered.d)
precis(model, prob = 0.99)
```

**Answer:**

Compared with the parameters in the lab, the intercept `a` changes a lot (from $7$ to $148$), while slope `b` and standard deviation `sigma` are almost unchanged. `a` can be interpreted as the expectation of `age` in every sample.

The change of `a` can be calculated as follows, where $E()$ is the expectation function.

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{age} &= a + b \cdot \text{height}\\\
E(\text{age}) &= E(a + b \cdot \text{height})\\\
E(\text{age}) &= a + b\cdot E(\text{height})\\\
a &= E(\text{age}) - b\cdot E(\text{height})
\end{aligned}$$

When height is centered, $E(\text{height})$ becomes $0$, so $a = E(age)$ in every sample.

## Problem 2 (4 points)

Now:

- create a standardized tree height variable

- plot tree age (y-axis) vs. the standardized tree height variable (x-axis)

- fit a linear regression model for tree age using standardized tree height as the predictor variable (use the same priors and start values as in Problem 1)

Summarize your fit model parameters using 99% PIs. How do the parameter posteriors in this model compare to the linear regression fit with the centered tree height variable? How do you interpret the slope parameter in this model?

```{r, out.width = "25em", fig.align = "center"}
d = read.csv('simulated_trees.csv')
std.height = (d$height - mean(d$height)) / sd(d$height)
std.d = data.frame(std.height, d$age)
colnames(std.d) = c('std.height', 'age')
ggplot(std.d, aes(x = std.height, y = d$age)) + 
	geom_point() + 
	xlab('Standardized Height') + 
	ylab('Age') + 
	ggtitle('Age ~ Standardized Height')
model = map(
	alist(
		age ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), 
		mu <- a + b * std.height,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 50),
		b ~ dnorm(0, 50),
		sigma ~ dcauchy(0, 5)),
	start = list(a = 50, b = 0, sigma = 50),
	data = std.d)
precis(model, prob = 0.99)
```

**Answer:**

`a` can be interpreted as the expectation of `age`, and `b` can be interpreted as the standard deviation of `age`.

The change of `a` has been explained above.

The change of `b` can be calculated below, where $Var()$ is the variance function.

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{age} &= a + b \cdot \text{height}\\\
Var(\text{age}) &= Var(a + b \cdot \text{height})\\\
Var(\text{age}) &= b^2\cdot Var(\text{height})\\\
b^2 &= \frac{Var(\text{age})}{Var(\text{height})}
\end{aligned}$$

When `height` is standardized, $Var(\text{height})$ becomes $1$. So $b$ changes.

Thus, $Var(\text{height}) = 1\text{ and }b^2 = Var(\text{age}),\ b = \sqrt{Var(\text{age})}$.

## Problem 3 (2 points)

Using the model you fit in Problem 2, generate 10,000 tree age predictions for a tree of average height (i.e., the average in the `simulated_trees` dataset). Report the mean and 50% HPDI of these predictions, and visualize the predictions using a density plot.

```{r, out.width = "25em", fig.align = "center"}
sample = extract.samples(model, 10000)
preds = rnorm(10000, mean = sample$a + sample$b * mean(std.height), sd = sample$sigma)
print(mean(preds))
print(HPDI(preds, 0.5))
dens(preds)
```
