# Data Cleaning

To practice data cleaning, in this week's lab, we'll be using [published data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201817) on RNA viruses collated by Mark Woolhouse and Liam Brierley. This dataset contains trait information gathered from the scientific literature on 214 RNA viruses that are known to infect humans. See the ["Data Records"](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201817#data-records) section of the published paper for information on the variables included in the dataset. I've downloaded the data and converted it to a CSV file for your ease of use. Find the data on either the class CourseWorks page or the class GitHub repository as `Woolhouse_and_Brierley_RNA_virus_database.csv`. 


## Exercise 1: Data Import

Download the Woolhouse and Brierley data, and import it into R, assigning it to an object named `viruses`. Run `summary()` on this object. You'll get a load of information in return, but this is just to familiarize yourself broadly with the dataset.

```{r}
setwd('D:/Codes/ClassCodes/')
viruses = read.csv('Woolhouse_and_Brierley_RNA_virus_database.csv')
summary(viruses)
```


## Exercise 2: Code Translation

For this series of exercises, you'll be given a chunk of code that does some data manipulation in base R. Your goal is to describe what this code is doing (in text below the code) and then translate that data manipulation operation using `dplyr` functions (in the empty code chunks). The `dplyr` solution will hopefully be simpler and more intuitive to you (which is why I'm encouraging you to learn `dplyr`). However, as an R user, you'll also be seeing lots of code written with base R functions, so best to be able to understand the basics of data manipulation with these built-in functions as well.

a) 

The codes below are trying to find and output rows (observations) whose `Family` column is `Coronaviridae`.
  
- Base R code:

```{r}

viruses[viruses$Family == "Coronaviridae", ]
```

- `dplyr` equivalent: 

```{r}
filter(viruses, Family == 'Coronaviridae')
```

b)

The codes below are trying to slice the origin dataframe's 1-10 rows and 1, 2, 3, 7 columns, and output the result.

- Base R code:

```{r}

viruses[1:10, c(1, 2, 3, 7)]
```

> Hint: Look at the `dplyr` function called `slice()` using `?slice()`.

- `dplyr` equivalent:

```{r}
select(slice(viruses, 1:10), c(1, 2, 3, 7))
```

c)

The codes below are trying to get rows whose `Envelope` feature equal to 0 and get `Species` column from these rows, and then sort the single column Alphabetically.

- Base R code:

```{r}

sort(viruses$Species[viruses$Envelope == 0])
```

- `dplyr` equivalent:

```{r}
viruses %>%
  filter(Envelope == 0) %>%
  arrange(Species) %>%
  select(Species)
```


## Exercise 3: Code Annotation

In the following series of exercises, you will be provided with functioning R code of `dplyr` data manipulation pipelines. Your goal is to comment these code blocks line-by-line, describing what each function is doing to create the final output. Please note, if you're not sure how a given line is functioning within the whole code block, this type of code is easily run in successively larger chunks. In other words, start by running the first line, then the first two lines, then the first three lines, etc. in order to see how the output changes. Additionally, reviewing function help files (e.g., `?some_function()`) may shed light on what's happening.

a)

```{r}

viruses %>%
#Input the viruses dataset using pipeline
  mutate(Envelope_mod = ifelse(Envelope == 1, "enveloped", "not enveloped")) %>%
  #Create a new column named 'Envelope_mod'. If the row's 'Envelope' feature
  #equal 1, assign its 'Envelope_mod' with 'enveloped'. Otherwise,
  #assign with 'not envepoed'.
  filter(Discovery.year >= 1990) %>%
  #Find rows with 'Discovery.year' feature larger than or equal to 1990.
  filter(Transmission.level %in% c("3", "4a", "4b")) %>%
  #Find rows with 'Transmission.level' feature equal to '3' or '4a' or '4b'.
  select(Family, Species, Envelope_mod) %>%
  #Select 'Family', 'Species', 'Envelope_mod' three columns.
  #Sort first by 'Family' column, then, by 'Species' column.
  arrange(Family, Species)
```

b)

```{r}

viruses %>%
#Input the viruses dataset using pipeline
  filter(Discovery.year >= 1990) %>%
  #Find rows with 'Discovery.year' larger or equal to 1990
  filter(Transmission.level %in% c("3", "4a", "4b")) %>%
  #Find rows with 'Transmission.level' feature equal to '3' or '4a' or '4b'.
  group_by(Family) %>%
  #Classify the dataset into several groups by their 'Family' column.
  #Rows with same 'Family' will be in same group.
  summarize(
  #Create a new dataframe to store data below
    n = n(),
    #Get number of rows of each group.
    n_enveloped = sum(Envelope),
    #Get the sum of 'Envelope' of each group.
    proportion_enveloped = (n_enveloped/n)*100
    #Get the ratio of envelope species to all the species in a group
  ) %>%
  #Sort the summary dataframe by the 'n' column,
  #from the largest to the smallest.
  arrange(desc(n))
```

> What do you notice about the `proportion_enveloped` column?

> **Answer:** It is either 0% or 100%.

c)

```{r}
#Input the viruses dataset using pipeline
viruses %>%
  #Classify the dataset into several groups by their 'Family' column.
  #Rows with same 'Family' will be in same group.
  group_by(Family) %>%
  #Get a summary dataset. Write it with a column named 'n_envelope_types'
  #whose values are the number of the kinds of 'enveloped'
  #or 'non-enveloped', namely, 1 or 2.
  summarize(n_envelope_types = n_distinct(Envelope)) %>%
  #Sort the summary dataset by decreasing n_envelope_types number.
  arrange(desc(n_envelope_types))
```

> What do you learn from this data summary about the number of distinct envelope types per viral family?

> **Answer:** The viruses in one family have the same enveloped feature. That is, either all are enveloped, or all are non-enveloped.


## Bonus Exercise: Install `rethinking`

If you have not yet installed the `rethinking` package, now would be a good time to try to do so, using the instructions at https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking.
